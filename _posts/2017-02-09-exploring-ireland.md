### Ireland is a fantastic country.
The scenery is just breathtaking, the people are full of life, and there is a ton of things to do. I took a ten day trip to Ireland in May with one of my favorite people and we loved everything about the entire experience. I highly recommend making the journey to the Emerald Island; you’ll have a fantastic time! I love Ireland because you are so disconnected from everything else in the world that you can simply **soak in the beauty around you**. I’ve put together the tips and highlights from our trip and my recommendations for how to spend your time.

### Things to Know

##### HOW WAS THE WEATHER?
We got incredibly lucky with the weather. We had researched before we went and found that it was probably going to be kind of cold and rainy, but we only had one day of rain. The rest of the days were sunny and 55–60º.
![{{ page.image_alt_02}}]({{ page.image_src_02 }})
I found the most important piece of clothing for me, was a **light windbreaker** that I could put a fleece underneath, it was perfect for the temperature and the wind.

**Dining** <br>
Expect dinner to take a while, since **you don’t need to tip**; the service is a bit different. It’s a slower pace of living, so if you are ready to go you have to be clear about needing the bill; otherwise the waiter might not ever come back, and you could sit there for three hours.

**Driving** <br>
![{{ page.image_alt_24 }}]({{ page.image_src_24 }})
Driving is an experience, but **it isn’t as awful as everyone will tell you** it is going to be. First of all, I drive a Jeep Grand Cherokee normally, and our rental car was a tiny Nissan. So it’s the equivalent of driving a go-kart for me. So honestly that was the hardest part to get used to, figuring out how to get used to the size change and the wrong side of the road took me a few, but once I got it, it honestly wasn’t that bad. There are some very tight mountain passes and narrow roads, but there are a lot of pull offs, so you don’t need to worry too much.


### Dublin

##### First Impressions of Dublin
Adorable houses&ensp;+&ensp;Lots of bicycles&ensp;+&ensp;Friendly people&ensp;+&ensp;Cheerful music&ensp;+&ensp;Great beer

##### Where to Stay
**Charleville Lodge Hotel**<br>
Cute little brick bed and breakfast<br>
<a class="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Charleville+Lodge+Hotel/@53.3591528,-6.279834,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xfab8c8e98a60557a?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjnhPG3xITSAhXHiFQKHWGvBqQQ_BIImgEwCg">View the Location</a>
![{{ page.image_alt_12}}]({{ page.image_src_12 }})

**Hilton Dublin Airport Hotel**<br>
At the end of a very long trip, sometimes you just want a working, high-pressure shower.<br>
<a class="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hilton+Dublin+Airport/@53.403489,-6.17976,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xa75a87859bc67058?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjkgOnlzoTSAhUm7oMKHRG5CmQQ_BIIjgEwCg">View the Location</a>

##### Where to Eat
**Vat House**<br>
This is a great place to stop for a snack. Pro Tip: If you purchase a Hop On, Hop Off bus ticket, they will give you a free Guinness!<br>
<a class="inline-link" href="http://vathouse.ie/">Restaurant Website</a>

**Old Guinness Storeroom**<br>
This place has great live music, a very friendly atmosphere, and fantastic drinks.<br>
<a class="inline-link" href="http://theoldstorehouse.ie/">Restaurant Website</a>

##### Things to Do
**Walking!**<br>
There are so many places to walk to in Dublin with so many interesting things to see. When we arrived, we were pretty dead tired since we flew overnight and probably got about three hours of sleep combined. We walked along the canal, which is an excellent way to stay awake and try to get used to the time difference, yet not take up too much energy. We walked 11.7 miles the first day alone.
![{{ page.image_alt_13}}]({{ page.image_src_13 }})
**Hop On, Hop Off Bus**<br>
This is fun because you get a tour of the whole city and you can get on and off as many times as you want.<br><br>
**Explore around Temple Bar**<br>
Definitely big city vibe, it’s pretty busy. It's a great place to enjoy a meal and a drink.<br><br>
**St. Peter’s Church**<br>
Amazing architecture with a huge, wonderful park to relax in for a bit.
![{{ page.image_alt_28}}]({{ page.image_src_28 }})
**Guinness Tour**<br>
It's neat to learn how Guinness is made. In the tasting room, learn how to identify the different flavors within Guinness. On the top floor is a 360º glass room where you can see the entire city of Dublin, with the mountains in the distance.
![{{ page.image_alt_16}}]({{ page.image_src_16 }})
![{{ page.image_alt_17}}]({{ page.image_src_17 }})
![{{ page.image_alt_18}}]({{ page.image_src_18 }})

##### Travel
**Take a taxi to your hotel! Or find a good map.**<br>
We took a bus from the airport to downtown Dublin, but we weren’t sure the best route to take or what stop to get off of so we ended up lugging our suitcases pretty far to our lodging.

##### What We Would Do Next Time
We wish we would have attended a rugby game, but our time was kind of short in Dublin.

### Galway

##### First Impressions of Galway
Young and hip&ensp;+&ensp;Bustling little town&ensp;+&ensp;Tons of shopping&ensp;+&ensp;Beautiful views

##### Stay
**The White House**<br>
This bed and breakfast was so beautiful and it was right on the ocean.<br>
<a class="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/White+House/@53.2642538,-9.0688214,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x3a2a4a017d3909bf!8m2!3d53.2642538!4d-9.0688214">View the Location</a>
![{{ page.image_alt_33}}]({{ page.image_src_33 }})

##### Eat
**McDonagh's**<br>
This restaurant is right in the middle of the shopping centre. They serve amazing fish and chips and you can sit outside on the patio.<br>
<a class="inline-link" href="http://www.mcdonaghs.net/restaurant.html">Restaurant Website</a>

**Butlers Chocolate Café**<br>
While this is a chain, the chocolate is delicious.

##### Things to Do**
**Strolling the City Centre**<br>
There is a lot of great shopping, large variety of restaurants, and authentic pubs. When you need a rest, Eyre Square is a perfect place to chill and people-watch.<br><br>
**Visit Cathedrals**<br>
There are so many cathedrals everywhere you go with amazing architecture, stain glass, and intricate details. <br><br>
**Cliffs of Mohr**<br>
![{{ page.image_alt_32 }}]({{ page.image_src_32 }})
Hands down, if you only do one thing in Ireland. Do this and bask in the beauty. We took a bus tour which picked us up from our hotel and started off towards the mountains through little country villages. The driver provided a lot of information about the history of Ireland and stopped at a lot of scenic locations so that we could snap some incredible photographs.
![{{ page.image_alt_03 }}]({{ page.image_src_03 }})
![{{ page.image_alt_04 }}]({{ page.image_src_04 }})
Cliffs of Mohr is one of the most unreal locations I’ve ever visited.
![{{ page.image_alt_05 }}]({{ page.image_src_05 }})
**Aeewien Caves**<br>
During the bus tour to Cliffs of Mohr, one of the stops was at Aeewien Caves; it was a neat little side stop.<br><br>
**Visit Country Castles**<br>
It feels like every mile there is a different castle which appears on the horizon.

##### Travel
**Busses are key!**<br>
We took a bus from Dublin to Galway which only cost us about €18 and was about a three-hour trip. We then took a bus from Galway to Limerick which cost about €16 and was about an hour and a half ride.

##### What We Would Do Next Time
We would recommend staying at least two nights in Galway; our time felt too short in this town. Visit Cliffs of Mohr again, seriously it’s amazing, and I could spend forever there.

### Limerick

##### First Impressions of Limerick
Not a ton to do&ensp;+&ensp;Stores and restaurants close early

##### Stay
**Limerick City Hotel**<br>
Pretty close to the main street, very much a fancier hotel.<br>
<a class="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/''/''/@52.6609754,-8.7031905,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x485b5c63c3b791d7:0x30424acfecb3d99f!2m2!1d-8.633151!2d52.660996">View the Location</a>

##### Eat
**Copper Room**<br>
The Copper Room is a wine and cheese bar with a copper ceiling and a hardcore night date vibe. It's exclusively candle lit and they play traditional Irish music.<br>
<a class="inline-link" href="http://thecopperroom.ie/">Restaurant Website</a>
![{{ page.image_alt_06 }}]({{ page.image_src_06 }})

**Tom Collins Pub**<br>
Authentic Irish pub which was incredibly packed.<br>
<a class="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tom+Collins/@52.6612816,-8.6278314,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb22edb1de6e43b36!8m2!3d52.6612816!4d-8.6278314">Restaurant Website</a>

**Hook and Ladder**<br>
Very tasty breakfast joint<br>
<a class="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hook+%26+Ladder+Sarsfield+Street/@52.6641827,-8.6279408,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x1587b3e2419b28e4!8m2!3d52.6641827!4d-8.6279408">Restaurant Website</a>

##### Things to Do
**Milk market**<br>
Giant flea market with lots of food, crafts, and shopping.<br><br>
**St. John’s Castle**<br>
Ever heard of Robin Hood? This castle is a history buff's dream, we learned a lot about castles and the history of Ireland.<br><br>
**St. Mary’s Cathedral**<br>
This is a cool landmark to visit and learn more about Irish culture and history.

##### Travel
**Bus**<br>
We took a bus from Limerick to Killarney which cost about €16 and was about an hour ride.

##### What We Would Do Next Time
To be honest, we wouldn’t go back to Limerick, and if we did, we would only spend one night.

### Killarney

##### First Impressions of Killarney
True Irish Vibe&ensp;+&ensp;Natural beauty is outstanding&ensp;+&ensp;Friendly people&ensp;+&ensp;Lots of things to do
![{{ page.image_alt_14}}]({{ page.image_src_14 }})

##### Stay
**Park Place Apartments**<br>
We stayed here for a week and had two bedrooms, a full kitchen and living room, a huge porch. We loved staying here because we could go and do a bit of grocery shopping and not have to buy every meal. This place is right on the main street in Killarney.<br>
<a class="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Park+Place+Apartments/@52.061475,-9.510855,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x9ee7d7d9e7e9cf8e!8m2!3d52.061475!4d-9.510855">View the Location</a>

##### Eat
**Irish Whiskey Experience**<br>
We did a whiskey and cheese tasting, which was such a cool experience. This bar is a very chill environment with complex cocktails.<br>
<a class="inline-link" href="https://www.irishwhiskeyexperience.net/">Restaurant Website</a>
![{{ page.image_alt_30}}]({{ page.image_src_30 }})
![{{ page.image_alt_29}}]({{ page.image_src_29 }})
**Skellig Chocolate Company**<br>
If you drive along the Atlantic Way, you have to stop here and get some free chocolate samples. We ended up buying a lot of treats.<br>
* <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.skelligschocolate.com/welcome/opening-hours-to-the-public/">Restaurant Website</a><br><br>
**Murphys Ice Cream**<br>
Handmade salted ice cream from Dingle which a lot of unique flavors. I had Gin and Raspberry, delish!<br>
<a class="inline-link" href="http://www.murphysicecream.ie/">Restaurant Website</a><br><br>
**Robertinos**<br>
It sounds funny because it was Italian food, but some of the best food we had while in Ireland.<br>
<a class="inline-link" href="http://www.robertinosrestaurant.com/">Restaurant Website</a>

##### Things to Do
**Shopping**<br>
Best shopping in Ireland!<br><br>
**Ross Castle**<br>
You can walk here from the city centre. There is a little lake with mountains in the distance and tranquil nature paths.<br><br>
**Drive to Dingle and Shea Head**<br>
You drive along the Atlantic Coast, it’s gorgeous, not enough words to describe.
![{{ page.image_alt_23}}]({{ page.image_src_23 }})
Driving is great because you can stop whenever you want. Stop and see the Beehive Huts which are rock shelters. Dingle was my favorite Irish town because of the brightly colored buildings and it is honestly what you expect Ireland to be like before you go.
![{{ page.image_alt_10}}]({{ page.image_src_10 }})
![{{ page.image_alt_09}}]({{ page.image_src_09 }})
There is excellent shopping. We visited a leather shop where the owner made a bracelet for me as I stood in the shop. It was wonderful to watch her craftsmanship and bring home a unique leather piece.
![{{ page.image_alt_21 }}]({{ page.image_src_21 }})
**Rent Bikes**<br>
Highly recommended biking, it was one of our favorite things we did on our trip. We biked 12 miles through the national park with views of mountains and lakes the entire time. Every time we turned a corner we would say “It can’t get more beautiful and perfect than this…” and then we would turn the next corner and be proven wrong. You can also bike to Torc Waterfall, you'll pass Mucross House on the way which is an incredible view.
![{{ page.image_alt_01}}]({{ page.image_src_01 }})
![{{ page.image_alt_20}}]({{ page.image_src_20 }})
**Drive the Ring of Kerry**<br>
We drove along the Atlantic Way, it was about 9 and a half hours round trip. We had a foggy start to our drive, but there were still plenty of neat places to stop and see along the way. Drove past Skellig, little too foggy for us to see the ocean, but the landscape was amazing. We visited Valcerian Island, from the top you can see the ocean, mountains, and towns below.
![{{ page.image_alt_19}}]({{ page.image_src_19 }})
There are sheep everywhere in the road, just expect to see them anywhere you go.
![{{ page.image_alt_26}}]({{ page.image_src_26 }})
![{{ page.image_alt_27}}]({{ page.image_src_27 }})
**Visit Kenmare**<br>
Kenmare is a tiny, busy town with a lot of shopping. You can visit the stone circles and there is a wishing tree where you can attach a wish. I loved this one: "I wish to have a good laugh every day."
![{{ page.image_alt_31}}]({{ page.image_src_31 }})
**Gap of Dunloe**<br>
You can drive through the black valley, DON'T DO THIS! It's so scary... what an experience. This is definitely not for the weak stomach. The road is narrow, steep, and winding. However, at the bottom of the hill there was a lovely river with a ton of sheep.
![{{ page.image_alt_15}}]({{ page.image_src_15 }})

##### Travel
**Rental car**<br>
We loved having a car in Killarney because there are so many day trips that you can make, and we had the freedom to stop whenever we wanted.
![{{ page.image_alt_22}}]({{ page.image_src_22 }})
We drove our rental car from Killarney to Dublin to finish up our trip which was about a 5 and a half hour drive.

##### What We Would Do Next Time
Spend just as long if not longer in Killarney, we were there for a week and we could have spent our whole trip there.
![{{ page.image_alt_07}}]({{ page.image_src_07 }})
We wish we would have gone horseback riding! We kept talking about riding horses through some of the nature trails, but we ran out of time.

### Simply on of the best trips I've ever taken.
I loved everything about Ireland, it was a fantastic trip and I got to spend a ton of time with one of my favorite friends.
![{{ page.image_alt_11}}]({{ page.image_src_11 }})
