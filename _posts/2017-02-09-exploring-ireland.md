### Summary
Ireland is a fantastic country. The scenery is just breathtaking, the people are full of life, and there is a ton of things to do. I took a ten day trip to Ireland in May with one of my favorite people and we loved everything about the entire experience. I highly recommend making the journey to the Emerald Island; you’ll have a fantastic time! I love Ireland because you are so disconnected from everything else in the world that you can simply **soak in the beauty around you**. I’ve put together the tips and highlights from our trip and my recommendations for how to spend your time.

### Things to Know
**Weather** <br>
We got incredibly lucky with the weather. We had researched before we went and found that it was probably going to be kind of cold and rainy, but we only had one day of rain. The rest of the days were sunny and 55–60º.
![{{ page.image_alt_02}}]({{ page.image_src_02 }})
I found the most important piece of clothing for me, was a **light windbreaker** that I could put a fleece underneath, it was perfect for the temperature and the wind.

**Dining** <br>
Expect dinner to take a while, since **you don’t need to tip**; the service is a bit different. It’s a slower pace of living, so if you are ready to go you have to be clear about needing the bill; otherwise the waiter might not ever come back, and you could sit there for three hours.

**Driving** <br>
![{{ page.image_alt_24 }}]({{ page.image_src_24 }})
Driving is an experience, but **it isn’t as awful as everyone will tell you** it is going to be. First of all, I drive a Jeep Grand Cherokee normally, and our rental car was a tiny Nissan. So it’s the equivalent of driving a go-kart for me. So honestly that was the hardest part to get used to, figuring out how to get used to the size change and the wrong side of the road took me a few, but once I got it, it honestly wasn’t that bad. There are some very tight mountain passes and narrow roads, but there are a lot of pull offs, so you don’t need to worry too much.


### Dublin
**First Impressions of Dublin**

1. Adorable houses
2. Lots of bicycles
3. Friendly people
4. Cheerful music
5. Great beer

**Where to Stay**

1. Charleville Lodge Hotel
* <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Charleville+Lodge+Hotel/@53.3591528,-6.279834,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xfab8c8e98a60557a?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjnhPG3xITSAhXHiFQKHWGvBqQQ_BIImgEwCg" target="_blank">View the Location</a>
* Cute little brick bed and breakfast
![{{ page.image_alt_12}}]({{ page.image_src_12 }})
2. Hilton Dublin Airport Hotel
* <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hilton+Dublin+Airport/@53.403489,-6.17976,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xa75a87859bc67058?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjkgOnlzoTSAhUm7oMKHRG5CmQQ_BIIjgEwCg" target="_blank">View the Location</a>
* At the end of a very long trip, sometimes you just want a working, high-pressure shower.

**Where to Eat**

1. Vat House
* <a class="inline-link" href="http://vathouse.ie/" target="_blank">Restaurant Website</a>
* Great place for a snack!
* If you purchase a Hop On, Hop Off bus ticket, they will give you a free Guinness
2. Old Guinness Storeroom
* <a class="inline-link" href="http://theoldstorehouse.ie/" target="_blank">Restaurant Website</a>
* Great live music
* Friendly atmosphere
* Fantastic Drinks

**Things to Do**

1. Walking!
* There are so many places to walk to in Dublin with so many interesting things to see. When we arrived, we were pretty dead tired since we flew overnight and probably got about three hours of sleep combined. We walked along the canal, which is an excellent way to stay awake and try to get used to the time difference, yet not take up too much energy. We walked 11.7 miles the first day alone.
![{{ page.image_alt_13}}]({{ page.image_src_13 }})
2. Hop On, Hop Off Bus
* Fun, because you get a tour of the whole city and you can get on and off as many times as you want.
* Also, cool trick. Vat House will give you a free Guinness if you have a bus ticket.
3. Walk around Temple Bar
* Definitely big city vibe, it’s pretty busy.
![{{ page.image_alt_11}}]({{ page.image_src_11 }})
4. St. Peter’s Church
* Amazing architecture.
* Huge, wonderful park to relax in for a bit.
![{{ page.image_alt_28}}]({{ page.image_src_28 }})
5. Guinness Tour
* Learn how Guinness is made.
* Tasting room, learn how to identify the different flavors within Guinness.
* Top floor is a 360º glass room where you can see the entire city of Dublin, with the mountains in the distance.
![{{ page.image_alt_16}}]({{ page.image_src_16 }})
![{{ page.image_alt_17}}]({{ page.image_src_17 }})
![{{ page.image_alt_18}}]({{ page.image_src_18 }})

**Travel**

1. Take a taxi to your hotel! Or find a good map.
* We took a bus from the airport to downtown Dublin, but we weren’t sure the best route to take or what stop to get off of so we ended up lugging our suitcases pretty far to our lodging.

**What We Would Do Next Time**

1. We wish we would have attended a rugby game, but our time was kind of short in Dublin.

### Galway

**First Impressions of Galway**

1. Young and hip
2. Bustling little town
3. Tons of shopping
4. Beautiful views

**Stay**

1. The White House
* <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/White+House/@53.2642538,-9.0688214,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x3a2a4a017d3909bf!8m2!3d53.2642538!4d-9.0688214" target="_blank">View the Location</a>
* Right on the ocean
![{{ page.image_alt_33}}]({{ page.image_src_33 }})

**Eat**

1. McDonagh's
* <a class="inline-link" href="http://www.mcdonaghs.net/restaurant.html" target="_blank">Restaurant Website</a>
* Amazing fish and chips
* Outdoor seating
* Right in the middle of the shopping centre
2. Butlers Chocolate Café
* While this is a chain, the chocolate is delicious

**Things to Do**

1. Strolling the City Centre
* Lots of great shopping
* Large variety of restaurants
* Authentic pubs
* Eyre Square is a perfect place to rest, and people-watch
2. Visit Cathedrals
* There are so many cathedrals everywhere you go with amazing architecture, stain glass, and intricate details.  
3. Cliffs of Mohr
* Hands down, if you only do one thing in Ireland. Do this and bask in the beauty.
* We took a bus tour which picked us up from our hotel and started off towards the mountains through little country villages. The driver provided a lot of information about the history of Ireland and stopped at a lot of scenic locations so that we could snap some incredible photographs.
* Cliffs of Mohr is one of the most unreal locations I’ve ever visited.
![{{ page.image_alt_03 }}]({{ page.image_src_03 }})
![{{ page.image_alt_04 }}]({{ page.image_src_04 }})
![{{ page.image_alt_05 }}]({{ page.image_src_05 }})
![{{ page.image_alt_32 }}]({{ page.image_src_32 }})
4. Aeewien Caves
* During the bus tour to Cliffs of Mohr, one of the stops was at Aeewien Caves; it was a neat little side stop.
5. Visit Country Castles
* It feels like every mile there is a different castle which appears on the horizon.

**Travel**

1. Busses are key!
* We took a bus from Dublin to Galway which only cost us about €18 and was about a three-hour trip.
* We then took a bus from Galway to Limerick which cost about €16 and was about an hour and a half ride.

**What We Would Do Next Time**

1. We would recommend staying at least two nights in Galway; our time felt too short in this town.
2. Visit Cliffs of Mohr again, seriously it’s amazing, and I could spend forever there.

### Limerick
**First Impressions of Limerick**

1. Not a ton to do
2. Stores and restaurants close early

**Stay**

1. Limerick City Hotel

**Things to Do**

* Little lake with mountains in the distance

* Dingle was my favorite Irish town
  * Brightly colored buildings and honestly what you expect Ireland to be like before you go.
  * Excellent shopping. We visited a leather shop where the owner made a bracelet for me as I stood in the shop. It was wonderful to watch her craftsmanship and bring home a unique leather piece.
  ![{{ page.image_alt_21 }}]({{ page.image_src_21 }})
  ![{{ page.image_alt_22}}]({{ page.image_src_22 }})
  ![{{ page.image_alt_23}}]({{ page.image_src_23 }})
4. Rent Bikes
* Highly recommended biking, it was one of our favorite things we did on our trip. We biked 12 miles through the national park with views of mountains and lakes the entire time. Every time we turned a corner we would say “It can’t get more beautiful and perfect than this…” and then we would turn the next corner and be proven wrong.
![{{ page.image_alt_01}}]({{ page.image_src_01 }})
![{{ page.image_alt_20}}]({{ page.image_src_20 }})
* Bike to Torc Waterfall

* We drove along the Atlantic Way, it was about 9 and a half hours round trip.
* We had a foggy start to our drive, but there were still plenty of neat places to stop and see along the way.

6. Visit Kenmare

* Shopping
* Visit the stone circles
![{{ page.image_alt_31}}]({{ page.image_src_31 }})
![{{ page.image_alt_26}}]({{ page.image_src_26 }})
7. Gap of Dunloe
* Through the black valley, DON”T DO THIS! So scary haha what’s an experience
* Not for the weak stomach
* Narrow, steep, winding road
* Bottom of the hill there was a lovely river with a ton of sheep
![{{ page.image_alt_15}}]({{ page.image_src_15 }})

**Travel**

* We drove our rental car from Killarney to Dublin to finish up our trip which was about a 5 and a half hour drive.

**What We Would Do Next Time**

1. Spend just as long if not longer in Killarney.
2. Horseback riding! We kept talking about riding horses through some of the nature trails, but we ran out of time.
![{{ page.image_alt_07}}]({{ page.image_src_07 }})
