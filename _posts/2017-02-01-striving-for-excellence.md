### Why do details matter?
Have you ever seen a sentence, a website, or a product and had a feeling that something wasn’t quite right? You can’t quite place your finger on the issue, but there is a distracting feeling somewhere in the experience. Odds are, details are causing you to miss out on the optimal experience.

*For example:* “There celebration was fantastic, everyone was having the time of their life.” The detail of using incorrect spelling and punctuation distracts from the purpose of the sentence.

Our world is made up of details that come together to make something bigger. If these details are incorrect, they become broken or vague, and the entire whole suffers.

### Why should we care about the details?
I’ve always been someone who lives in the details. I am constantly looking for patterns of organization and predictability which can be utilized to make any experience stronger. I believe we can always do better; **we can always push ourselves to refine and perfect.** I’ve never understood not wanting to strive for optimal performance and experiences. Why wouldn’t we want to produce the very best experience for our users?

### Yeah, but my budget is small. Our scope is tight. Perfection takes time. I’m not a detail-oriented person.
Do what you can with what you have. We don’t have to do everything and we are never going to reach the perfect solution. I’m not proposing that we should all reach for 100% or just give up. I’m merely suggesting that we all **try harder to produce quality work** for everything we create no matter the budget, the timeline, the goal, etc. I think there is a common misconception that focusing on details means obtaining perfection. Perfection is something we should always strive for, but most likely, it isn’t achievable. Focusing on details means that **we are contributing to something bigger than the current piece of the puzzle.** By focusing on the details wherever we are in an experience, we are helping to form the larger picture.

### What can we do?
Too often, we settle. We settle in our jobs, we settle in our lifestyles, we settle in our goals. Let’s change the landscape and the expected.

> Let’s try for something better and something more meaningful. Let’s do more with what we have and inspire those around us. Let’s try.

### How do we encourage participation?
We can all try to contribute to the best of our abilities. We can get outside of our comfort zones because we know it will contribute to something bigger and stronger than what currently exists. We can hold each other accountable by creating guidelines and checklists which help us remember what to review before an experience gets created, delivered, or produced. It’s important to work hard and know that there is always more work to be done. **We don’t want good enough—we want great.** We want this ‘knock your socks off’ feeling. When we finish a presentation, we want the audience, to leave the room and say “Damn, that was great! I want to be kick ass too.” We want our solutions and experiences to inspire others to do more and work harder. We have to keep each other accountable for this kind of work. We have to **set an expectation of excellence** instead of an expectation of mediocrity.

### Where is a practical place to start?
There are a few small things we can start with because, let’s face it, it’s hard to change our behaviors and it’s hard to remember the details sometimes.

**Listen.**<br>
There is nothing better than giving whatever you are participating in your full attention. Take the time to care about where you are and learn everything you can.

**Seek knowledge.**<br>
The more information you can gather around the current initiative, the more you will be able to stay educated, catch mistakes, and contribute robust ideas throughout the process.

**Double check.**<br>
It never hurts to double check, triple check, and have someone else check. Your work will look more professional, and getting a second opinion can offer you a new perspective on the problem.

**Ask questions.**<br>
If you don’t know something, ask a question. If you want a second opinion, ask for it. Never, ever, be afraid to ask, because nothing bad can come from expanding your knowledge on a topic.

**Don’t worry.**<br>
Try not to stress. No one is going to catch everything. Just do the best you can and press on.

**Keep striving.**<br>
There is a great quote that Tom Brady once said: “I didn’t come this far, to only come this far.” Keep pushing for whatever gets you pumped: for perfection, for excellence, for something better.

### Give it a go.
I have a list of the items above along with a few more daily reminders on a sticky note on my desk. It helps me remember what I’m aiming to achieve every time I sit down to work. Do what works for you and let’s help each other stay on the path to creating compelling experiences.
