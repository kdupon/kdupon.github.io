description: >
  This classic ravioli is fun to make and well worth the extra effort. The creaminess of the filling with the sweet and nutty sauce is a perfect balance that will satisfy any hunger. If you don't feel like taking on the task of making handmade pasta or if you just want to save a little bit of time, you can use premade pasta sheets instead. 

total_time: 2 Hours
servings: 24
skill_level: Expert
oven_temperature: 450

ingredients:
  - 3 cups flour
  - 1 tsp. salt
  - 4 eggs
  - 2 T. olive oil
  - 12 plum tomatoes
  - Salt and pepper
  - 2 cups balsamic vinegar, plus a little to sprinkle
  - 1/2 cup brown sugar
  - 1 egg yolk
  - Basil leaves
  - Mozzarella balls
  - Pesto sauce

instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 450º.
  - Start with making the dough. In a stand mixer with a dough hook, combine the flour and salt. Add eggs in one at a time. Add in 1 T. olive oil.
  - Flour a work surface and knead dough until it becomes elastic and smooth.
  - Wrap the dough completely in plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes.
  - While the dough is resting, slice the tomatoes. Place on a greased baking sheet and drizzle with 1 T. oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper. Roast the tomatoes for 25–30 minutes or until slightly blackened.
  - While you are waiting for the dough and the tomatoes, start the glaze. In a small saucepan, combine 2 cups balsamic vinegar and the brown sugar. Stir until the brown sugar is dissolved.
  - Bring mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the glaze is reduced by half. This should take about 20 minutes. You will most likely have extra; you can store it in a container and keep it in the fridge.
  - Cut the dough in half and wrap one-half back into the plastic wrap. This will help make sure the dough doesn't dry out until you are ready to use it.
  - Re-flour your work surface and roll your pasta dough out until it's about 1/8 inch thick.
  - Lay the sheet of pasta on a floured surface and brush the egg yolk on the top of the dough.
  - Now you will fill the ravioli. Place a leaf or two of basil on the dough, place a roasted tomato, and a mozzarella ball on top. Continue placing the filling on the dough, about 1 inch apart.
  - Fold the dough over the filling and cut between each ravioli.
  - Pinch the sides around each ravioli so that the filling is secure.
  - Bring a salted pot of water to a boil.
  - Cook the ravioli until tender (this should only take a few minutes). Drain.
  - Coat the ravioli with pesto sauce. Add the extra roasted tomatoes and drizzle the balsamic glaze on top.
  - Whew, you are done. Enjoy!
