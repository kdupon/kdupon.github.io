  I'm not lying when I say this is hands down my favorite black bean burger. Combining spicy peppers, with creamy feta, and the meatiness of black beans makes for an elaborately flavored meal that is easy to make.

total_time: 45 Minutes
servings: 6-8
skill_level: Easy

ingredients:
  - 2 15 oz cans of black beans
  - 4 T. vegetable oil
  - 1 medium onion, finely chopped
  - 1 large poblano pepper, finely chopped
  - 3 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 chipotle chili in adobo sauce, finally chopped
  - 1 tsp. adobo sauce
  - ½ cup crumbled feta
  - ¼ cup chopped cilantro
  - ¾ tsp. cumin
  - 2 T. mayo
  - 1 egg
  - ¾ cup panko breadcrumbs
  - ½ tsp. salt
  - ½ tsp. Pepper
  - Pretzel buns, toasted or Wraps
  - Condiment recommendations - chipotle mayonnaise, pepper jack cheese lettuce, onions

instructions:
  - On a baking sheet, with aluminium foil, spread black beans in a single layer. Roast for around 20 minute or until beans split and outer skins become crunchy. Remove the beans from the oven and allow to cool.
  - Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a medium sized skillet. Add onion and poblano, cook until vegetables become softened, around 5 minutes.
  - Add garlic, cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
  - Add chipotle and sauce, cook and stir for 30 seconds.
  - Transfer skillet mixture to a large bowl.
  - Take slightly cooled beans and crumbled feta and place in a food processor, pulse until the beans are about ⅓ of the original size.
  - Place the bean mixture into the vegetable bowl. Add cilantro, cumin, mayo, egg, and breadcrumbs season with salt and pepper. Mix contents of the bowl with hands.
  - Make patty sizes the same width as the pretzel buns.
  - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a cast iron skillet (or large non-stick pan). Add patties to pan and cook for 5 minutes on each side.
